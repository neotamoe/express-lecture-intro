// brew is a package manager for macOS (we used it to install node)
// node has its own package manager called npm

// 1) when you first start node project, must be in your project folder and then run $ npm init --yes
// this turns the directory into a node project and creates a json package
// 2) then in terminal run $npm install express --save (still in your folder)
// this creates dependencies which says which version of express you're using AND adds the node_modules folder
// 3) make file called .gitignore
